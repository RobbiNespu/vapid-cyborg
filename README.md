# Vapid Cyborg
Mobile-first theme for WordPress, focus on typography with very little images to slow things down. The goal of this project is to create a lightweight theme centered around content instead of extravagant design, fitting as much information on the page as possible without compromising usability.

## Features
### Site News
The leftmost column of the theme contains the site news section, a micro post format suitable for updates regarding the site. I will also be giving the option to use this area as a widget location at some point.
### Main Content
The main information the site needs to get across is displayed prominently to the right. This is the only section where advanced typography is available, and everything is designed in a way that gives the main focus to the content. There are no distracting featured images, and limited meta info. The posts are not shortened by excerpts by default, so that all the information you want your audience to read is available on the front page.
## Built using Tailwind CSS
Vapid Cyborg uses Tailwind, my absolute favorite framework.
