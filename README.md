# Vapid Cyborg
Mobile-first theme for WordPress, heavy on typography with very little images to slow things down. The goal of this project is to create a theme with a focus on content over superfluous design, fitting as much information on the page as possible without compromising usability.

## Features
### Site News
The leftmost column of the theme contains the site news section, a micro post format suitable for short updates regarding the current site. I will also be giving the option to use this area as a widget location.
### Main Content
The main information the site needs to get across is displayed prominently in the center. This is the only section where advanced typography is available, and everything is designed in a way that gives the main focus to the content. There are no distracting header images, and limited meta info. The posts are not shortened by excerpts by default, so that all the information you want your audience to read is available on the front page.
### Global News
The right-most section is another micro post formatted area for short posts that might not be worthy of clogging up the main content with. I envision this as a perfect place for tweet-like news updates on matters related to the site subject. I will also be giving the option to use this area as a widget location.

## Built using Tailwind CSS
Vapid Cyborg uses Tailwind, my absolutely favorite framework. Tailwind lets me quickly design the site I'm imagining without ever switching files, and lets me focus on being creative.
